title: Roadmap to Smart Contracts
---

### Step by Step Approach  

  

* [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)  - this is the recommended book for having a good grasp on ethereum as a blockchain and smart contract network

* [Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps) -  this helps us understand the two main consensus algorithm and how they are different from one another 

* Solidity Fundamentals: These are a couple of resources one can use to start learning solidity from stratch 

  * [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)

  * [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/index.html)

  * [Interactive learning solidity](https://cryptozombies.io/) 

  * [Smart Contract Programmer - Solidity 0.8](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO5VPQH6OWdVQwpQfw9rZ67O6Pjfo6q-p)

    

* Smart Contract Testing: These are the frameworks used for contract developement, testing and debugging 

  * [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/other-guides/waffle-testing) - Ethereum development environment for professionals

  * [Better Programming Hub](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-complete-hands-on-hardhat-tutorial-9e23728fc8a4) - tutorial for hardhat

  * [Code Eater (Hindi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuqhHOx6188&list=PLgPmWS2dQHW9mucRpDVe16j9Qn74ZXqcD&index=5) - Testing of Smart contract using Mocha Framework

  * [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) - modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust

  * [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)- Comprehensive Ethereum Developer Platform for real-time monitoring, alerting, debugging, and simulating Smart Contracts (also has premium plans)

   
  

*  CTFs - These are a couple of ctf that can you started with how one can find bugs in a smart contract

  * [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)

  * [Capture The Ether](https://capturetheether.com/)

  * [Damm Vulnerable Defi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/)

 * [CipherShastra](https://ciphershastra.com/)

   

* Postmortems - These are some of the websites and people one can follow to stay updated about new techinques and attacks happening in web3 space

  * [Immunefi](https://medium.com/@immunefi)

  * [BlockSec](https://blocksecteam.medium.com/)
